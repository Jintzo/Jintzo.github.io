My name is Jens, I work in Data Engineering for Robotics at [ArtiMinds Robotics](https://artiminds.com). Previously, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu/) and worked in Data Mining for Production Control at [Daimler AG](https://daimler.com).

My main interests are

- production control for modern production environments,
- real-time handling and analysis of large amounts of data and
- modern web technologies.

I occasionally contribute to [open source projects](https://github.com/jens-ox) and enjoy running and cycling.
