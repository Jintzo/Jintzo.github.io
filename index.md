title: Hi!
---

My name is Jens Ochsenmeier, I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu/) and work in Data Engineering for Robotics at [ArtiMinds Robotics](https://artiminds.com). Previously, I worked in Data Mining for Production Control at [Daimler AG](https://daimler.com). 

My main interests are
- production control for modern production environments,
- real-time handling and analysis of large amounts of data and
- modern web technologies.

I occasionally contribute to [open source projects](https://github.com/jens-ox) and enjoy running and cycling.
