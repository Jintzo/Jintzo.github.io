# Hi!

My name is Jens Ochsenmeier, I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu/) and work in Data Mining for Production Control at [Daimler AG](https://daimler.com). 

My main interests are
- visualization & analysis of large datasets,
- security research & malware analysis and
- modern web technologies.

I occasionally contribute to [open source projects](https://github.com/Jintzo) and enjoy running and cycling.
